Official implementation of **[Hyp-OC : Hyperbolic One Class Classification for Face Anti-Spoofing]()**.
<hr />

## Highlights

Hyp-OC, is the first work exploring hyperbolic embeddings for one-class face anti-spoofing (OC-FAS).

1Ô∏è‚É£ We show that using hyperbolic space helps learn a better decision boundary than the Euclidean counterpart, boosting one-class face anti-spoofing performance.<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ We propose Hyperbolic Pairwise Confusion Loss (Hyp-PC), that operates on the hyperbolic space inducing confusion within the hyperbolic feature space,
effectively stripping away identity information. Such disruption of features helps to learn better feature representations for the FAS task.<br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ We provide a hyperbolic formation of cross-entropy loss (Hyp-CE), that uses hyperbolic softmax logits and penalizes the network for every misclassification.<br>

> **<p align="justify"> Abstract:** *Face recognition technology has become an integral part of modern security systems
> and user authentication processes. However, these systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks and can easily be circumvented.
> Most prior research in face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches it as a two-class classification task where models are trained
> on real samples and known spoof attacks and tested for detection performance on unknown spoof attacks. However, in practice,
> FAS should be treated as a one-class classification task where, while training, one cannot assume any knowledge regarding
> the spoof samples a priori. In this paper, we reformulate the face anti-spoofing task from a one-class perspective and
> propose a novel hyperbolic one-class classification framework. To train our network, we use a pseudo-negative class sampled
> from the Gaussian distribution with a weighted running mean and propose two novel loss functions: (1) Hyp-PC: Hyperbolic
> Pairwise Confusion loss, and (2) Hyp-CE: Hyperbolic Cross Entropy loss, which operate in the hyperbolic space. Additionally,
> we employ Euclidean feature clipping and gradient clipping to stabilize the training in the hyperbolic space. To the best of
> our knowledge, this is the first work extending hyperbolic embeddings for face anti-spoofing in a one-class manner. With
> extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets: Rose-Youtu, MSU-MFSD, CASIA-MFSD, Idiap Replay-Attack, and OULU-NPU, we
> demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving better spoof detection performance.* </p>
